        Believe me it's never the same old shit
        It's a different shit every time you walk out
        Demons, ready to rip you off, sniff at every piece of you
        To them you're nothing but a chunk of meat
        But it's not the same old you too
        You come out much stronger much wiser and hungrier
        The only thing that remains out of your old battles is your human heart
        The very heart that keeps you humane
        The very heart that creates the fine line between the demons and you
