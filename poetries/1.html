        That night when you cried and said 
        You may not be the first one but my last, yes.
        
        Your face, it was warm like the sun
        Your breath, it was slow like a breeze
        Your lips, soft and those small pearly eyes you have,
        They were moist telling me that this was the eternal truth
        My heart,  it fluttered maybe for a sec or two
        Wanting to believe your every word
        Wanting to create our own world
        But my mind said love, it's momentary it's delusional
        A part of me wanted to say that's a lie
        And a part of me knew from a short memory we shared
        I shut my heart for once 
        For once I put my mind first 
        
        Never argued on the forever
        Smiled thinking of the momentary forever
        And it was such a happy memory
        
        Yes, a memory. A deep set most heartfelt memory
        For once I was glad I followed my mind
        For my heart, it was too fragile to lose you more than once
